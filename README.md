# CoffeePOS Documentation - Josh Stephenson T1A3

## Software Development Plan

1. Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

My app will function as a very basic point of sale(pos) system for a coffee shop. The user, whom will be the person selling the coffee, will be able to create a coffee order with parameters for how the customer would like their coffee, check their current inventory and check on a customers loyalty program.

The reason I am developing this app is to provide a zero cost basic solution for POS for a coffee shop. There are many POS systems out there but they can be extremely expensive. My app will be completely free to whomever wants to use it.

This app is obviously targetted towards small coffee shop owners as this will be a free and easy way to manage the selling of coffee, tracking inventory and the implimentation of a loyalty program built into the application.

The entire program will run through terminal with the user interacting through text based prompts. I have designed it to be operated by any user regardless of coding experience. The user simply needs to read on screen and input what they would like to do. For example, enter '1' to create an order from the main menu or enter '2' to access the inventory. The most important function of the app is creating the coffee order and this is done by prompting the user for each parameter for making a coffee ie. Type? Size? Milk? Sugar?
